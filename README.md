## Quickstart Guides

### Folding

If you find some troubles with reading `vimrc` by every section is folded. Just type `zR`, then all foldings are open, or hit `Space` to open each folding.

### Leader

By default, Leader key is mapped to `Space`.

### Colorschemes

The following additional coloschemes are available:

- [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
- [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf)
- [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)
- [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim)
- [papercolor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme)

Add the theme you prefer in `~/.vimrc.local`, like:

```vim
colorscheme molokai
```

See the website for each colorscheme for details.

### Indentation

Indent styles for major filetypes are defined in `.vim/after/ftplugin`. When you don't like them and want to change them, it's the recommended way to overwrite them in `.vimrc.local` instead of directly modify these files:

e.g.)

If you want to change HTML indent size from 2 spaces to 4 spaces, add the following to `.vimrc.local`:

```vim
augroup HTML
  autocmd!
  autocmd FileType html set tabstop=4
  autocmd FileType html set shiftwidth=4
  autocmd FileType html set softtabstop=4
augroup END
```

### Prettify JSON

You can prettify a JSON buffer by invoking `:PrettyJson`.
It uses `jq` by default and fallbacks to use Python 2.x if `jq` is not available.

### vim-airline

vim-airline provides nice looking status line. Visit https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline for details.

Also, you can change vim-airline theme via vim-airline-themes by setting `let g:airline_theme='<theme name>'` in `~/.vimrc.local`, e.g.:

```vim
let g:airline_theme='simple'
```

You can find the full list ofg themes on https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes
